# Bounded Context: Reports

## Context Explanation

The **Reports** bounded context is responsible for generating analytical views, summaries, and detailed performance metrics across the platform.

Reports provide different types of insights depending on the persona accessing them:

- **Students** track their personal progress and achievements.
- **Tutors** monitor the performance of students under their responsibility.
- **Administrators** oversee the operational and educational success of their institution.
- **Institutions** analyze broader engagement, performance, and growth indicators.

Reports are strictly **read-only representations** and do not modify underlying data.  
They are generated by aggregating data from multiple bounded contexts (Content, Assessment, Enrollment, Certificate).

Hierarchy of data (conceptual):

```plaintext
Institution
  ├── Users
  ├── Courses
  ├── Enrollments
  ├── Certificates
  └── Reports (various perspectives depending on persona)
```

## Business Rules

- Reports must be **filtered by institution** to ensure tenant isolation — no user can see data outside their institution.
- Each persona must have access only to the reports relevant to their role:
  - **Students** can see only their own data.
  - **Tutors** can see students under their supervision.
  - **Admins** can see aggregated data for the whole institution.
  - **Institution Managers** can see global insights.
- Reports are **generated based on real-time or periodically refreshed data**.
- Reports must be **consistent** with the underlying bounded contexts (e.g., only COMPLETED Enrollments should be considered in completion statistics).
- Some reports (like InstitutionGrowthReport) could be enhanced over time with historical tracking for long-term analytics.
