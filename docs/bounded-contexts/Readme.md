# ðŸ“š Bounded Contexts Documentation

## Overview

This directory documents the **Bounded Contexts** of the Learning Management Platform (LMS).  
Each Bounded Context defines a **clear responsibility area** inside the platform, following **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.

The goal is to maintain strong **modularity**, **scalability**, and **clarity**, ensuring that each part of the system grows independently while maintaining a unified business vision.

## What is a Bounded Context?

In Domain-Driven Design, a **Bounded Context**:

- Clearly **defines boundaries** around a model and its meaning.
- **Isolates terminology and rules** inside its area.
- **Owns its data, logic, and behavior**.
- Allows multiple teams to work independently without semantic conflicts.

Each Bounded Context encapsulates **entities**, **value objects**, **business rules**, and **relationships** related to a specific domain area.

## How to Navigate this Documentation

Each file in this directory describes:

- **Context Explanation**: The functional and business purpose of the context.
- **Hierarchy of Data**: Visual representation of the structure.
- **Entities and Responsibilities**: Description of each entity's role.
- **Key Attributes**: Functional importance of critical attributes.
- **Business Rules**: Specific rules and behaviors enforced in the context.

You can open any context-specific `.md` file to quickly understand:

- What the bounded context is about.
- What entities exist and how they interact.
- What business logic governs the behavior.

## List of Bounded Contexts

| Context          | Description |
|:-----------------|:------------|
| [User](./user.md) | Manages students, tutors, administrators, and their profiles. |
| [Institution](./institution.md) | Organizes users, courses, and certificates into isolated institutions. |
| [Content](./content.md) | Structures educational materials (courses, modules, lessons, content). |
| [Enrollment](./enrollment.md) | Handles student registrations in courses and tracks completion. |
| [Certificate](./certificate.md) | Issues and manages formal course completion certificates. |
| [Reports](./reports.md) | Provides analytical insights for students, tutors, admins, and institutions. |
| [Badges](./badges.md) | Rewards students with achievements to drive engagement through gamification. |

## Why is this Important?

- ðŸ“ˆ **Faster Onboarding**: New developers and product owners can understand the system quickly.
- ðŸ§  **Clearer Communication**: Everyone speaks the same language about the domain.
- ðŸš€ **Better Scalability**: Each context can evolve independently without breaking others.
- ðŸ”’ **Stronger Isolation**: Helps ensure tenant isolation and data privacy.

---

# ðŸ“Œ Good Practices

- Always start by understanding the **Context Explanation** before diving into entities or code.
- Respect the **Boundaries** of each context: avoid cross-context coupling unless using clear integration patterns (e.g., events, contracts).
- Update the documentation whenever significant changes happen inside a bounded context.

# ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

This structure ensures that our Learning Management Platform grows **cleanly**, **scalably**, and **professionally** over time.

Enjoy building with clarity! ðŸš€
