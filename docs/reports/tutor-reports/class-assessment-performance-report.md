## Business Rules

### Access Control
- Tutors can only access reports for their assigned classes
- Reports are filtered by institution for tenant isolation
- Class-tutor relationship validation is required

### Data Privacy
- Student personal information is limited to name and email
- Individual scores are only shown to authorized tutors
- Aggregated data maintains student anonymity where possible

### Performance Thresholds
- **Pass Rate**: 60% or higher score
- **Risk Levels**:
  - Low Risk: Average score ‚â• 75%
  - Medium Risk: Average score 60-74%
  - High Risk: Average score < 60%
- **Difficulty Classification**:
  - Easy: Average score ‚â• 80%
  - Medium: Average score 60-79%
  - Hard: Average score < 60%

## Implementation Notes

### CQRS Pattern
This report follows the CQRS pattern:
- No domain entities are used
- Direct repository queries for data aggregation
- Read-only data transformation and formatting
- Dependency injection for repository access

### Performance Considerations
- Large classes may require pagination
- Complex statistical calculations may need caching
- Question-level analysis can be computationally intensive
- Consider async processing for detailed reports

### Error Handling
- Validate tutor access to class before processing
- Handle cases with no assessment data gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages for invalid filters
- Log performance metrics for monitoring
