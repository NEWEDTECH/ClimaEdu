- Historical data queries can be resource-intensive
- Consider pagination for large datasets
- Implement async processing for detailed reports

### Real-time Updates
- Engagement metrics updated in near real-time
- Performance data updated after assessment completion
- Risk assessment recalculated on significant events
- Notification triggers for critical risk levels

### Integration Points
- Learning Management System (LMS) integration
- Student Information System (SIS) connectivity
- Parent portal data sharing
- Academic advisor dashboard integration

## Alert Triggers

### Automatic Notifications
- **Critical Risk**: Immediate tutor notification
