## Important Configurations

- **Next.js App Router**:  
  The project uses the standard Next.js 15 App Router. All pages are in `src/app/`.

- **React Server Components**:  
  Used where appropriate to improve performance on pages that don't require immediate interactivity.

- **TailwindCSS**:  
  Customized via the `tailwind.config.ts` file.  
  Additional plugins like `@tailwindcss/forms` and `@tailwindcss/typography` can be used.

- **shadcn/ui**:  
  All components are generated and placed inside `src/components/ui/`.

- **Firebase SDK**:  
  Firebase access is done in a modularized way in `src/shared/firebase/firebase-client.ts`.

- **ESLint + Prettier**:  
  Configured to maintain clean and formatted code standards.

- **Composition via DI Container**:  
  All UseCases and Repositories are resolved in the Frontend by the `container` (Inversify) through Symbols.

- **Memory Bank and Cline**:  
  The platform is built with support for Cline, using Memory Bank and custom project rules.

## Conventions

- **Strict TypeScript Usage**:  
  No part of the code should ignore type errors (`any`, `@ts-ignore` should be avoided).

- **Modular Architecture**:  
  Each domain (user, content, enrollment, assessment, forum, certificate, report) has its own folder organization.

- **Clean Code**:  
  Rigorous application of Clean Architecture, SOLID, and Object Calisthenics.
