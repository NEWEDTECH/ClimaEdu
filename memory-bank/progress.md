# Progress

## Current Project Status

- **Complete Memory Bank**:  
  All Memory Bank files have been created, organizing the architecture, design patterns, technological context, and functional scope of the platform.

- **Architecture defined and implemented**:  
  The system uses Clean Architecture, SOLID, Object Calisthenics, and Container Pattern to resolve dependencies, with the base structure already implemented.

- **Technology stack implemented**:  
  - Next.js 15 (App Router + React Server Components)
  - React 19
  - TailwindCSS
  - shadcn/ui
  - Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
  - TypeScript (strict mode)
  - InversifyJS for dependency injection

- **Domain Model Implemented**:
  - User: User entity, Email and Profile value objects, UserRole enum
  - Content: Course, Module, Lesson, Content, Activity, Questionnaire, Question entities
  - Assessment: QuestionSubmission and QuestionnaireSubmission entities
  - Enrollment: Enrollment entity and EnrollmentStatus enum
  - Institution: Institution entity and InstitutionSettings value object
  - Certificate: Certificate entity
  - Badge: Badge and StudentBadge entities, BadgeCriteriaType enum
  - Report: Various report entities for different personas (Student, Tutor, Admin, Institution)

- **Initial modules implemented**:  
  - User: entities, repositories, and creation use case.
  - Content: entities, repositories, and creation use case.

## Important Decisions Made

- **Container Pattern with Inversify** implemented to resolve UseCases in React, maintaining decoupling.
- **No controllers** in the presentation layer (React). UseCases are resolved via Container.
- **Firebase** configured as a solution for authentication, database, and file storage.
- **TypeScript in strict mode** configured throughout the project.
- **Next.js 15** and **React 19** implemented, with decorator support for InversifyJS.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete authentication implementation**:
   - Develop `AuthenticateUserUseCase`.
   - Create login and registration pages.
   - Implement route protection.

2. **Content module development**:
   - Implement `ListContentsUseCase`.
   - Create interface for file uploads.
   - Develop content viewing by category.

3. **Enrollment module implementation**:
   - Implement use cases for student enrollment.
   - Develop interface for enrollment management.

4. **Assessment module implementation**:
   - Implement use cases for questionnaire submission.
   - Create interface for taking quizzes and viewing results.

5. **Certificate generation**:
   - Implement use cases for certificate issuance.
   - Create certificate templates and generation logic.

6. **Badge system implementation**:
   - Implement use cases for badge awarding.
   - Create interface for viewing earned badges.

7. **Reporting system**:
   - Implement use cases for generating reports.
   - Create dashboards for different personas.

8. **Dashboard development**:
   - Create views for administrators.
   - Implement reports and metrics.

9. **Testing and refinements**:
   - Implement unit tests.
   - Refine the user interface.
   - Optimize performance.

## Observations

- The project's base structure is implemented following the practices defined in the Memory Bank.
- To test the system, it is necessary to configure the environment variables in the `.env.local` file with Firebase credentials.
- New features should follow the same architectural pattern already established.
- The Cline assistant should continue to be used to accelerate code generation following these guidelines.
