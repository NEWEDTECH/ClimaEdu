# Product Context

## Problems the System Solves

The Learning Content Management Portal was created to solve various problems faced by educational institutions and students in the context of digital education:

- **Decentralized content management**: Previously, educational content was scattered across multiple disconnected platforms. Now, the portal centralizes all teaching materials (videos, PDFs, podcasts).

- **Difficulty with access and authentication**: Students and tutors faced problems accessing legacy education systems. The portal offers modern, secure, and scalable authentication with Firebase.

- **Lack of organizational structure**: Old systems did not allow organizing students into institutions, classrooms, and groups. The new system enables organized enrollments and hierarchical management.

- **Low interactivity**: Without discussion forums and integrated tutoring, students felt isolated. The portal introduces forums and communication between students and tutors.

- **Ineffective assessments**: Old systems made it difficult to create and grade assessments. The portal facilitates the creation of digital questionnaires and automatic performance analysis.

- **Lack of progress recognition**: Students did not receive formal recognition upon completing courses. The portal solves this with the issuance of personalized certificates.

- **Absence of data for decision making**: Administrators had difficulty obtaining clear reports. The new portal offers centralized dashboards for performance and metrics.
